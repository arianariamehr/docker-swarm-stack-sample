# Swarm manager high availability (HA)  

Swarm managers have native support for high availability (HA). This means one or more can fail, and the survivors will keep the swarm running.  

Technically speaking, swarm implements a form of **active-passive multi-manager HA**. This means that although
you have multiple managers, only one of them is active at any given moment. This active manager is called the
`leader`, and the leader is the only one that will ever issue live commands against the swarm. So, it’s only ever the leader that changes the config, or issues tasks to workers. If a follower manager (`passive`) receives commands for the swarm, it proxies them across to the leader.

Step 1 is the command coming in to a manager from a remote Docker client. Step 2 is the non-leader manager receiving the command and proxying it to the leader. Step 3 is the leader executing the command on the swarm.  

**Note**: Notice that managers are either *leaders* or *followers*. This is Raft terminology, because swarm uses an implementation of the **Raft consensus algorithm** to maintain a consistent cluster state across multiple highly available managers.  

On the topic of HA, the following two best practices apply:  
1. Deploy an odd number of managers.
2. Don’t deploy too many managers (3 or 5 is recommended)  

Having an odd number of managers reduces the chances of split-brain conditions. For example, if you had 4
managers and the network partitioned, you could be left with two managers on each side of the partition. This
is known as a `split brain` — each side knows there used to be 4 but can now only see 2. But crucially, neither
side has any way of knowing if the other two are still alive and whether it holds a majority (`quorum`).  

However, if you have 3 or 5 managers and the same network partition occurs, it is impossible to have an equal
number of managers on both sides of the partition. This means that one side achieves quorum and full cluster
management services remain available.
