# Swarm services

Services let us specify most of the familiar container options, such as name, port mappings, attaching to networks, and images. But they add important cloud-native features, including desired state and automatic reconciliation. For example, swarm services allow us to declaratively define a desired state for an application that we can apply to the swarm and let the swarm take care of deploying it and managing it.  

You can create services in one of two ways:
1. Imperatively on the command line with `docker service create`
2. Declaratively with a stack file  

```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service create --name web-fe -p 8080:8080 --replicas 5 \
  nigelpoulton/pluralsight-docker-ci

overall progress: 5 out of 5 tasks 
1/5: running   
2/5: running   
3/5: running   
4/5: running   
5/5: running   
verify: Service 3sx6w83nv57nsf0xk4k1yfj08 converged

```  
Notice that many of the familiar docker container run arguments are the same.
