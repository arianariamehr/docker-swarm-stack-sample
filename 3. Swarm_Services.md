# Swarm services

Services let us specify most of the familiar container options, such as name, port mappings, attaching to networks, and images. But they add important cloud-native features, including desired state and automatic reconciliation. For example, swarm services allow us to declaratively define a desired state for an application that we can apply to the swarm and let the swarm take care of deploying it and managing it.  

You can create services in one of two ways:
1. Imperatively on the command line with `docker service create`
2. Declaratively with a stack file  

```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service create --name web-fe -p 8080:8080 --replicas 5 \
  nigelpoulton/pluralsight-docker-ci
3sx6w83nv57nsf0xk4k1yfj08
overall progress: 5 out of 5 tasks 
1/5: running   
2/5: running   
3/5: running   
4/5: running   
5/5: running   
verify: Service 3sx6w83nv57nsf0xk4k1yfj08 converged

```
Notice that many of the familiar docker container run arguments are the same. It’s important to understand that all service replicas use the same image and config!  

Remember that swarm managers also act as workers. Each worker or manager that received a work task pulled the image and started a container listening on port 8080. The swarm leader also ensured a copy of the service’s desired state was stored on the cluster and replicated to every manager.    

But this isn’t the end. All services are constantly monitored by the swarm — the swarm runs a background reconciliation loop that constantly compares the *observed state* of the service with the *desired state*. This behavior is a key tenet of cloud-native applications and allows the service to self-heal in the event of node failures and the likes.  


### Viewing and inspecting services  
You can use the `docker service ls` command to see a list of all services running on a swarm.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service ls
ID             NAME      MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE               PORTS
3sx6w83nv57n   web-fe    replicated   5/5        nigel...ci:latest   *:8080->8080/tcp
```  

The output shows a single running service as well as some basic information about state. If you run
this command soon after deploying the service it might not show all tasks/replicas as running. This is often due to the time it takes to pull the image on each node.  

You can use the `docker service ps` command to see a list of service replicas and the state of each.
```
root@swarm-manager-01:~# docker service ps web-fe 
ID             NAME       IMAGE               NODE               DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE                ERROR     PORTS
z83lkia1yfq3   web-fe.1   nigel...ci:latest   swarm-manager-03   Running         Running about a minute ago             
37a6eav1a2f3   web-fe.2   nigel...ci:latest   grafana-server     Running         Running about a minute ago             
s94aw6h0q3qo   web-fe.3   nigel...ci:latest   swarm-worker-02    Running         Running about a minute ago             
qz3ptnjcg4i8   web-fe.4   nigel...ci:latest   swarm-manager-01   Running         Running about a minute ago             
6csykij8cjty   web-fe.5   nigel...ci:latest   swarm-worker-01    Running         Running about a minute ago             
```  

The format of the command is `docker service ps <service-name or service-id>`. The output displays each replica (container) on its own line, shows whitch node in the swarm it’s executing on, and shows desired state and the current observed state.  

For detailed information about a service, use the `docker service inspect` command.
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service inspect --pretty web-fe 

ID:		hqsie0xzfoakj16pjktrtj22v
Name:		web-fe
Service Mode:	Replicated
 Replicas:	5

 Max failure ratio: 0
 Update order:      stop-first
RollbackConfig:
 Parallelism:	1

 Init:		false
Resources:
Endpoint Mode:	vip
Ports:
 PublishedPort = 8080
  Protocol = tcp
  TargetPort = 8080
  PublishMode = ingress 

```  

The example above uses the `--pretty` flag to limit the output to the most interesting items printed in an easy-to-read format. Leaving off the --pretty flag will give a more verbose output.  


### Replicated vs global services  
The default replication mode of a service is replicated. This deploys a desired number of replicas and distributes them as evenly as possible across the cluster.  
The other mode is `global`, whitch runs a single replica on every node in the swarm. To deploy a global service you need to pass the `--mode global` flag to the docker service create command.  


### Scaling a service
Another powerful feature of services is the ability to easily scale them up and down.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service scale web-fe=10
web-fe scaled to 10
overall progress: 10 out of 10 tasks 
1/10: running   [==================================================>] 
2/10: running   [==================================================>] 
3/10: running   [==================================================>] 
4/10: running   [==================================================>] 
5/10: running   [==================================================>] 
6/10: running   [==================================================>] 
7/10: running   [==================================================>] 
8/10: running   [==================================================>] 
9/10: running   [==================================================>] 
10/10: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service web-fe converged

```  

This command will scale the number of service replicas from 5 to 10. In the bachground it’s updating the service’s desired state from 5 to 10. Run another `docker service ls` command to verify the operation was successful.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service ls
ID             NAME      MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE               PORTS
hqsie0xzfoak   web-fe    replicated   10/10      nigel...ci:latest   *:8080->8080/tcp
```

Running a `docker service ps` command will show that the service replicas are balanced across all nodes in the swarm evenly.
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service ps web-fe
ID             NAME        IMAGE               NODE               DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE            ERROR     PORTS

```  

Behind the scenes, swarm runs a scheduling algorithm called **spread** that attempts to balance replicas as evenly as possible across the nodes in the swarm.  


### Removing a service
Removing a service is simple. The following `docker service rm` command will delete the service deployed earlier.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service rm web-fe
web-fe
```  

Confirm it’s gone with the `docker service ls` command.
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service ls
ID             NAME      MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE               PORTS
```  

**Note**: Be careful using the `docker service rm` command as it deletes all service replicas without asking for confirmation.
