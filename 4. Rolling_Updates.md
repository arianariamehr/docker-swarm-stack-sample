# Rolling updates

To see this, we’re going to deploy a new service. But before we do that, we’re going to create a new overlay network for the service. This isn’t necessary, but I want you to see how it is done and how to attach the service to it.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker network create -d overlay uber-net
hpadwii6inib4x7a9pbllchzb
```

This creates a new overlay network called *uber-net* that we’ll use for the service we’re about to create. An overlay network creates a new layer 2 network that we can place containers on, and all containers on it will be able to communicate. This works even if all of the swarm nodes are on different underlying networks. Basically, the overlay network creates a new layer 2 container network on top of potentially multiple different underlying networks.  

Bellow figure shows four swarm nodes on two underlay networks connected by a layer 3 router. The overlay network spans all 4 swarm nodes creating a single flat layer 2 network for containers to use.

Run a `docker network ls` to verify that the network created properly and is visible on the Docker host.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME              DRIVER    SCOPE
<Snip>
hpadwii6inib   uber-net          overlay   swarm
```

The `uber-net` network was successfully created with the swarm scope and is currently *only visible on m-anager nodes* in the swarm. It will be dynamically extended to worker nodes when they run workloads configured on the network.  

Let’s create a new service and attach it to the network.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service create --name uber-svc --network uber-net \
  -p 80:80 --replicas 12 nigelpoulton/tu-demo:v1
