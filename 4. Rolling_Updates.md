# Rolling updates

To see this, we’re going to deploy a new service. But before we do that, we’re going to create a new overlay network for the service. This isn’t necessary, but I want you to see how it is done and how to attach the service to it.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker network create -d overlay uber-net
hpadwii6inib4x7a9pbllchzb
```

This creates a new overlay network called *uber-net* that we’ll use for the service we’re about to create. An overlay network creates a new layer 2 network that we can place containers on, and all containers on it will be able to communicate. This works even if all of the swarm nodes are on different underlying networks. Basically, the overlay network creates a new layer 2 container network on top of potentially multiple different underlying networks.  

Bellow figure shows four swarm nodes on two underlay networks connected by a layer 3 router. The overlay network spans all 4 swarm nodes creating a single flat layer 2 network for containers to use.

Run a `docker network ls` to verify that the network created properly and is visible on the Docker host.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME              DRIVER    SCOPE
<Snip>
hpadwii6inib   uber-net          overlay   swarm
```

The `uber-net` network was successfully created with the swarm scope and is currently *only visible on m-anager nodes* in the swarm. It will be dynamically extended to worker nodes when they run workloads configured on the network.  

Let’s create a new service and attach it to the network.  
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service create --name uber-svc --network uber-net \
  -p 80:80 --replicas 12 nigelpoulton/tu-demo:v1

```  

Run a `docker service ls` and a `docker service ps` command to verify the state of the new service.
```

```  

This mode of publishing a port on every node in the swarm — even nodes not running service replicas — is
called `ingress mode` and is the default. The alternative mode is `host mode` which only publishes the service on swarm nodes running replicas. Publishing a service in host mode requires the long-form syntax and looks like the following:
```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service create --name uber-svc
  --network uber-net \
  --publish published=80,target=80,mode=host \
  --replicas 12 \
  nigelpoulton/tu-demo:v1
```

Open a web browser and point it to the IP address of any of the nodes in the swarm on port 80 to see the service running.

As you can see, it’s a simple voting application that will register votes for either “football” or “soccer”. You’ll be able to reach the web service from any node because the -p 80:80 flag creates an *ingress mode* mapping on every swarm node. This is true even on nodes that are not running a replica for the service — every node gets a mapping and can therefore *redirect* your request to a node that is running the service.  

Let’s also assume that you’ve been tasked with pushing the updated image to the swarm in a staged manner — 2 replicas at a time with a 20 second delay between each. You can use the following `docker service update` command to accomplish this.  

```
swarm-manager-01:~# docker service update --image nigelpoulton/tu-demo:v2 \
  --update-parallelism 2 \
  --update-delay 20s \
  uber-svc
